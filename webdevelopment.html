                        Fantasy cricket is a fantasy sports game where each player can make a team of 11 players. As the game starts, the users get points for the fantasy teams they have selected based on their performance in the real match. The points are given on the basis of runs, wickets and catches, among others.
                
                        To join a fantasy cricket league, you need to join a match and pick a fantasy team of 11 players that includes 1-6 batsmen, 1-6 bowlers, 1-4 wicket-keepers and 1-6 all-rounders. Along with it, you also need to select the Captain and Vice-Captain of the team.
                        
                        But what truly makes online fantasy cricket so interesting? Well, there is more than one reason for it.
                        
                        Create your team: Fantasy sports put you in control. You make your own cricket team 11 and then enjoy seeing them win a match. So, you can actually leave behind the frustrating feeling of watching a team play that you didn't agree to.</p>
